# Opal: Hackathon Pitch Deck

## 🎯 The Problem (Slide 1)

### Businesses Are Drowning in Data

Every day, organizations accumulate massive amounts of unstructured, multi-modal data:

- **Financial reports** (PDFs with complex tables)
- **Customer communications** (emails, chat logs)
- **Meeting recordings** (audio transcripts)
- **Whiteboard photos** (strategic planning sessions)
- **Operational spreadsheets** (KPIs, metrics, forecasts)

### The Current Solution Is Broken

**Traditional Approach:** Hire expensive human analysts to manually:
- Read through hundreds of documents
- Extract key insights
- Correlate information across sources
- Generate strategic recommendations

**Problems:**
- ⏱️ **Slow:** Takes days or weeks
- 💰 **Expensive:** $100K+ per analyst annually
- ❌ **Error-Prone:** Human fatigue and bias
- 🔒 **Security Risk:** Sensitive data exposure

### The Privacy Paradox

**Cloud AI Solutions:** Fast and powerful, but...
- Data must be uploaded to external servers
- Compliance violations (HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2)
- Risk of breaches and leaks
- Loss of competitive intelligence

**Result:** Businesses with sensitive data (healthcare, finance, legal) cannot safely use modern AI tools.

## 💡 Our Solution: Opal (Slide 2)

### Tagline
**"From messy data to boardroom-ready insights—without ever leaking your secrets."**

### What It Does

Opal is an **autonomous AI agent** that:

1. **Ingests** multi-modal business data (PDFs, images, audio, spreadsheets)
2. **Reasons** over the data using multi-step analytical workflows
3. **Acts** by generating actionable deliverables (memos, slides, scripts, voice summaries)
4. **Protects** sensitive information through privacy-by-design architecture

### Key Differentiators

| Feature | Traditional Tools | Cloud AI | Opal |
|---------|------------------|----------|-----------|
| **Multi-Modal** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Multi-Step Reasoning** | ❌ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| **Privacy-Preserving** | ⚠️ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Enterprise Integration** | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ (MCP) |
| **Actionable Outputs** | ❌ | ⚠️ | ✅ |

## 🔑 Core Innovations (Slide 3)

### 1. True Multi-Step Reasoning

**Not just Q&A—it investigates like a consultant:**

```
Ingest → Parse & Structure → Build Knowledge Graph → 
Generate Hypotheses → Validate → Diagnose Gaps → 
Generate Insights → Create Deliverables
```

**Example Workflow:**
- Analyzes Q3 financial report (PDF)
- Correlates with sales data (spreadsheet)
- Reviews board meeting transcript (audio)
- Identifies: "Q3 revenue dropped 12% in APAC"
- Generates hypothesis: "Supply chain disruptions + competitor pricing"
- Validates against operational data
- Produces: Strategic memo + SQL queries + slide deck

### 2. Privacy by Design

**Three-Layer Protection:**

**Layer 1: On-Device Processing**
- All AI inference runs locally (Llama.cpp, Whisper.cpp, ONNX)
- No data sent to external APIs
- Works completely offline if needed

**Layer 2: Automatic Redaction**
- NLP-based PII/PHI detection (names, SSNs, medical records)
- Computer vision redaction (faces, signatures, sensitive text in images)
- Pattern matching (credit cards, phone numbers, emails)

**Layer 3: Zero Data Retention**
- No persistent storage of sensitive data
- Volatile memory processing only
- Automatic cleanup after analysis

### 3. MCP-Powered Tool Orchestration

**The Future of Enterprise AI Integration:**

**Traditional Approach Problems:**
- Hardcoded API credentials (security risk)
- Pre-built connectors only (limited flexibility)
- Broad, persistent access tokens (compliance issues)

**MCP Approach:**
- **Dynamic Discovery:** Agent finds available tools at runtime
- **Temporary Tokens:** Request scoped, time-limited credentials
- **Tool Chaining:** Orchestrate complex workflows:
  ```
  extract_invoice(PDF) → validate_amount(SAP) → 
  check_approval(Workday) → notify_slack(CFO)
  ```

**Why This Matters:** Real enterprise integration without security vulnerabilities.

### 4. Multi-Modal Action Output

**Not just text—comprehensive deliverables:**

- 📝 **Strategic Memos:** Professional PDFs with citations
- 📊 **Slide Decks:** Auto-generated presentations with AI-created charts
- 💻 **Runnable Scripts:** SQL queries and Python code for reproducibility
- 🎙️ **Voice Summaries:** Audio briefings for busy executives

---

## 🏥 Target Industry: Healthcare Revenue Cycle (Slide 4)

### Why Healthcare?

**Market Size:** $100B+ in revenue cycle inefficiencies annually

**Perfect Fit for Opal:**
- ✅ High-stakes decisions (billing errors = lost revenue)
- ✅ Multi-modal data (EOBs, patient notes, insurance portals)
- ✅ Privacy-critical (HIPAA compliance non-negotiable)
- ✅ Clear ROI (20%+ reduction in claim denials)

### Demo Scenario: Claim Denial Resolution

**Current Process (5 days):**
1. Billing specialist receives denial notice
2. Manually reviews EOB document
3. Searches EHR for supporting documentation
4. Calls insurance company for clarification
5. Drafts appeal letter
6. Submits and tracks

**With Opal (5 minutes):**

**Input:**
- Scanned EOB (Explanation of Benefits)
- Doctor's voice note about patient case
- Insurance portal screenshot

**Processing:**
1. **Extract:** OCR identifies claim ID, denial code (CO-97), patient ID
2. **Redact:** Auto-blurs all PHI (patient name, DOB, MRN)
3. **Reason:** Analyzes denial code → "Missing prior authorization"
4. **Verify:** Queries EHR via MCP → "Prior auth submitted 10/1, ref #XYZ"
5. **Generate:** Creates appeal package

**Output:**
- ✅ Redacted denial analysis memo
- ✅ Auto-filled appeal letter (Word doc)
- ✅ Calendar invite for billing team follow-up
- ✅ Voice summary: "High-priority denial—resubmit with auth ref XYZ by 10/20"

**Impact:**
- ⚡ 99% faster resolution (5 days → 5 minutes)
- 💰 20%+ reduction in denied claims
- 🔒 100% HIPAA compliant
- 📈 Improved cash flow and reduced administrative burden

### Code Samples

**Multi-Modal Ingestion:**
```python
class MultiModalProcessor:
    def process(self, file_path: str) -> dict:
        if file_path.endswith('.pdf'):
            return self.pdf_processor.extract(file_path)
        elif file_path.endswith(('.jpg', '.png')):
            return self.image_processor.analyze(file_path)

```

**Privacy Redaction:**
```python
class RedactionEngine:
    def redact_text(self, text: str) -> str:

            if ent.label_ in ["PERSON", "GPE", "ORG"]:
                text = text.replace(ent.text, "[REDACTED]")
        return text
```
